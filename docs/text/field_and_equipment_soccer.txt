Field and Equipment (Soccer Rules)

1. Field Surface: The soccer field may be natural grass or approved artificial turf. The surface must be safe, consistent, and suitable for play.
2. Field Markings: The field is a rectangle marked with clear boundary lines. The long lines are touchlines, the short lines are goal lines, and a halfway line splits the field into two sides.
3. Center Area: A center mark and circle indicate where the game begins with a kick-off. All players must stay on their half until the ball is played.
4. Goal Area: In front of each goal is a small box used for specific restarts. A larger penalty area surrounds it and is used for goalkeeper privileges and penalty kick situations.
5. Corner Area: Each corner of the field includes a small arc where corner kicks are taken after the defending team last touches the ball out of play.
6. Flagposts: Flags mark the four corners of the field. They must be tall, safe, and placed outside the playing area.
7. Technical Area: Teams sit in a designated area on the sideline. Only authorized coaches, substitutes, and staff may occupy this space, and they must behave responsibly.
8. Goals: A goal has two upright posts connected by a crossbar. Goals must be secure, safe, and identical for both teams. Nets may be used to show when the ball enters the goal.
9. Player Equipment: All players must wear a jersey, shorts, socks, shin guards, and proper footwear. Shin guards must be covered, and jewelry is not allowed for safety reasons.
10. The Ball: The ball must be round, safe to use, and the correct size for the match level. If the ball becomes damaged during the match, the referee stops play and replaces it.
