Free Kicks (Soccer)

1. Direct Free Kick: Awarded for serious fouls and handball. A goal may be scored directly.
2. Indirect Free Kick: Awarded for non-contact offenses such as dangerous play or obstruction. If the goalkeeper handles the ball inside their own penalty area when not permitted to do so, an indirect free kick is awarded but there is no disciplinary sanction. 
3. Defensive Wall: Opponents must stay the required distance until the ball is kicked.
4. Quick Free Kick: Allowed if the kicking team chooses, unless the referee stops play for a card.
5. Kicker Restrictions: The kicker cannot touch the ball again until another player does.
6. Incorrect Procedure: If taken improperly, the free kick may be retaken.
