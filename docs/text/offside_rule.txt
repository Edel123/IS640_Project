Offside Rule (Soccer)

Offside Position:
1. A player is in an offside position if any part of their head, body, or feet is nearer to the opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-last defender. Arms and hands are not considered. A player cannot be offside on the halfway line.
2. Not an Offense by Itself: Being in an offside position is not a foul. A player is not offside if they are level with the second-last defender, or level with the last two defenders.
3. Offside Offense: A player commits an offside offense only if, at the moment a teammate plays the ball, they become involved in active play by:
playing or touching the ball, interfering with an opponent’s ability to play the ball, or gaining an advantage from their offside position (such as playing a rebound or deflection).
4. No Offside on Certain Restarts:
Offside cannot be called directly from a goal kick, corner kick, or throw-in. A player may freely receive the ball from these restarts without penalty.
5. Purpose of the Rule: The offside rule prevents attacking players from positioning themselves unfairly close to the opponent’s goal to gain an advantage.
6.Restart After Offside: When an offside offense occurs, the defending team is awarded an indirect free kick from the spot where the offside offense took place.
