Offside Rule (Soccer)

1. Offside Position: A player is offside if they are nearer to the opponent’s goal than both the ball and the second-last defender.
2. Not a Violation: Being in an offside position alone is not a foul. A player is not in an offside position if level with the second-last opponent or last two opponents.
3. Offside Offense: A player is penalized if they play the ball or interfere with an opponent from an offside position. • A player is offside if any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents’ half (excluding the halfway line).
4. No Offside Plays: Offside is not called on goal kicks, corner kicks, or throw-ins.
5. Purpose: The rule prevents attackers from gaining unfair positioning advantages.
6. Restart: An indirect free kick is awarded to the defending team when offside occurs.
