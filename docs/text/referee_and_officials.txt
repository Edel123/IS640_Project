Referees and Officials (Soccer)

1. Referee Role: The referee enforces the Laws of the Game and makes final decisions. The referee has the power to show yellow or red cards.
2. Assistant Referees: Help indicate offside, out-of-play decisions, and fouls.
3. Fourth Official: Manages substitutions, extra time displays, and technical area behavior.
4. VAR: Video Assistant Referees may assist with major decisions like goals and penalties. GLT systems may be used to verify whether a goal has been scored to support the referee’s decision.
5. Authority: Referees oversee player equipment, injuries, and match safety.
6. Signals: Referees and assistants use approved hand signals to communicate decisions.
7. Assistant Referees: Two assistant referees help the main referee by signaling when the ball goes out of play, identifying offside offenses, and assisting with fouls they can see more clearly.
8. Fourth Official: The fourth official manages substitutions, monitors the technical areas, checks player equipment, and displays the added time at the end of each half.
9. Video Assistant Referee (VAR): The VAR reviews major decisions such as goals, penalty kicks, direct red cards, and mistaken identity. The VAR can recommend a review to the referee.
10. Assistant VAR (AVAR): The AVAR supports the VAR by checking replays, managing communication, recording decision details, and ensuring accuracy during video reviews.
11. Additional Assistant Referees (when used): These referees stand near the goals to help judge goal-line incidents, fouls inside the penalty area, and other situations close to the goal.
12. Other officials: Assistant referees, the fourth official, the video assistant referee (VAR), the assistant VAR (AVAR), and additional assistant referees.”
