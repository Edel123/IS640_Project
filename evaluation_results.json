      "question": "What is the purpose of the offside rule in soccer?",
      "answer": " The offside rule in soccer exists to prevent a player from having an unfair advantage by being closer to the opponent's goal than the second-last defender and the ball, without there being a teammate between them. This encourages more balanced play and fairer game dynamics, as it discourages players from just camping near the opponent's goal in anticipation of a pass. The indirect free kick awarded to the defending team when offside occurs further emphasizes this intent by giving the opposing team an opportunity to regain possession and potentially counter-attack.",

      "answer": " The purpose of the offside rule in soccer is to prevent a team from exploiting numbers-based advantages, particularly after the opponents have lost possession of the ball. By forbidding players from being in an offside position until the ball has been played to them by a teammate who last touched it outside the opposing half, the rule discourages rapid forward movements and promotes fair play by restricting opportunities for uncontested shots on goal.",
